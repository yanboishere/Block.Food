# Introduction

  Language [English](https://github.com/yanboishere/Chain.Food/blob/master/README.md) | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](https://github.com/yanboishere/Chain.Food/blob/master/README_cn.md) 


The inspiration for this project came from a chance experience the author had. 

During a hackathon competition, many participants were unable to arrive at the venue on time in the morning, resulting in a surplus of breakfast provided by the organizers. This surplus was eventually wasted as the organizers had no way of distributing it.

---

Later that day, while visiting a convenience store, the author noticed a large quantity of discounted food that was set to be thrown away the next morning, as per company policy. 

![IMG_3085](https://github.com/yanboishere/Chain.Food/assets/76860915/0e17c760-29a0-4f0c-b8b6-2efc5a4323d1)

Affected by the company's policy, although these foods have been sold at a discount,(The food in the picture is less than $1) there are still a lot of surplus.
---

These experiences highlight the issue of food waste in urban areas, and the author was inspired to create a decentralized application (Dapp) called Chain Food to address this problem.

## Food Wasted Data

After that, I was interested in this and searched for related waste dataÔºö

ÔºàData from „ÄäThe Food Waste Index Report„Äã 

by the **Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)** Ôºâ

suggests:

> About 93.1 billion kilograms of food is wasted globally every year, equivalent to 17% of all food produced.

> Vegetables, roots, fruits and grains are the most commonly wasted food types in households.

> Food retailers and foodservice are among the largest sources of food waste, with supermarkets, restaurants and hotels being particularly wasteful links in their supply chains.

> Reducing food waste plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as the energy and resources required to produce, transport and process food result in significant carbon emissions.

The report reveals the magnitude of the food waste problem and calls for global action to reduce it. 

The numbers are astonishing.

And the most important,there's still many people were hunger.

## 828 million people worldwide face hunger

These food waste could have been avoided and keep less people hunger...but **why not for reuse before it waste?**

## In particular, our entire Ethereum ecosystem has hardly had dapps in the past, and the main goal is to truly do public welfare.

So,This is the main problem that our project aims to solve:

## Features

### Main Features

- Chain.Food is open to all restaurants, event organizers, and individuals who wish to register.
- Users who link their wallet to the platform can view information about free food nearby, as well as publish information and location about free food they are offering.
- During the exchange process, both parties need to enter their erc address (or scan its QR code)to **prove their identities on the chain.**
- Upon receipt or donation of food, users will receive FoodCoin tokens as an incentive from the platform.
- Users who post photos of their empty plates after consuming the received food can also earn FoodCoin rewards.
- Tokens can be redeemed for rewards at partner merchants or traded on exchanges.
- **Layer2 tokens can use the user's SBT proof to confirm that their personal information and address are valid and appreciate their public welfare actions.**
- Cooperate with related foundations and NEO members for funding and offline promotion Conduct online and offline promotion with members who are willing to join public welfare
- Cooperate with Web3 organizations such as Layer2 tokens and NFT issuers DAO, and use them as partners to carry out public welfare
- Relying on the openness and transparency of data on the chain, user and our charitable funds and processes will be **100% open and transparent to the society.**

### NFTs

Users who receive or donate food for the first time will receive an NFT reward. Additionally, users who continue to donate or publish "empty plate" posts may be eligible for additional NFT rewards. The NFT serves as proof that the user has used the application to save food.

#### First donate & receive

## Partnerships

Chain Food is willing to collaborate with Layer2 service providers to airdrop partnership funds to users in the form of blockchain assets.

## Social Responsibility - Donations

Chain.Food will donate the tax revenue and some of its profits earned from users obtaining [FoodCoin](https://github.com/yanboishere/Chain.Food/blob/master/FoodCoin.md) and minting NFTs to nonprofit organizations dedicated to donating food to underdeveloped regions and disaster-stricken areas in order to help them carry out such activities.

The ultimate goal of the project is to save **at least 500 tons of food waste and complete 10000 food exchange activities** within one year of the platform's launch, while continuing to support other nonprofit organizations. The aim is to make this project sustainable and help feed those who are in need so that they will not experience hunger due to environmental factors. 

## Objectives

We aim to achieve the following objectives within one year of the project's full launch:

- Save at least one ton of food waste
- Complete 10‚Äò000 food exchange activities on the platform
- Continue to support other nonprofit organizations' related activities

Let's work together to make sure that more people have access to food and are not hungry due to environmental factors.
